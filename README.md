## Directions

### Step #1 - Change the eyes <br>

Bucky's eyes are drawn as ellipses, and the last two numbers represent their width and height. Create a variable that stores the <b>eye size</b> and use that to change the size of both eyes. Once you've done that, have fun changing the variable value to make HUGE eyes and teeeeny tiny eyes.  
<br>

### Step #2 - Longer teeth! <br>

Bucky's buckteeth are drawn as rectangles, and the last number is the height of the rectangle. Create a variable to store the <b>length of the teeth</b> so that you can change the length of both buckteeth at once.
<br>

### Step #5 - Play! <br>

Add more code to the pde - variables, shapes, colors, etc.
